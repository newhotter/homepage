Hello, guys! I'm a Master degree candidate of China Center for Economic Research, Peking University. I have acquired the Bachelor's degree in the [School of Banking and Finance](http://sbf.uibe.edu.cn), University of International Business and Economics (Major in Financial Engineering). My scholar and technical interests are finance, economics and computer science(or precisely, computer skills).  So far, my research interests focus mainly on financial econometrics and economic theory. I am interested in  various computer skills. And I am unremitting to learn about it. A few years ago, I had been addicted to CG software such as [Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects](http://www.adobe.com), Nuke and [Houdini](http://www.sidefx.com) because I had a dream to be an artist creating special film effects. I love MATLAB(the first software package I used  for programming), R(because of its various packages for the  latest statistical methods), Python(it is a progamming language for daily work and fun!), C++(no need to give a reason for it), Julia（a new language that I think will dominate MATLAB, R and Python in scientific computing). And I have also in webpage technics, network technology, operating system and internet industry. I hate like MS Word(for me, it's hard to compose a good-look documentation)and Powerpoint(neither powerful nor pointful). I am looking forward to communications about scholar research and technical skiils (haoliu512@pku.edu.cn).


嗨，这里是刘浩的个人主页，我目前在北京大学国家发展研究院中国经济研究中心（CCER）读研究生一年级。现在最大的目标是出国读个PhD。我现在全身心的投入到了各种与学术科研有关的事情上。我很喜欢看别人的学术和技术博客。博客也将以主要以学术和技术为主。
