Hello, guys! I'm a Master's Degree candidate of China Center for Economic Research, National School of Development, Peking University. I have earned the Bachelor's degree in the [School of Banking and Finance](http://sbf.uibe.edu.cn), University of International Business and Economics (Major in Financial Engineering). My scholar and technical interests are finance, economics and computer science(or precisely, computer  and programming skills).  So far, my research focus mainly on financial econometrics and economic theory. I am interested in  various computer skills. And I am unremitting to learn about it. A few years ago, I was addicted to CG software such as [Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects](http://www.adobe.com), Nuke and [Houdini](http://www.sidefx.com) because I had a dream to be an artist creating special film effects. As for statistical programming, I love MATLAB(the first software package I used  for programming), R(because of its various packages for the  latest statistical methods), Python(a programming language for daily work and fun), C++(no need to give a reason for it), Julia(a new language  I think will dominate in scientific computing). And I am also interested in webpage technics, network technology, operating system and internet industry. I am looking forward to communications about scholar research and technical skiils (haoliu512@pku.edu.cn).
