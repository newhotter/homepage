Hello,guys! I'm a undergraduate student in the School of [Finance and Banking](http://sbf.uibe.edu.cn), University of International Business and Economics. I love finance and computer. I love finance because of its magic power to make the economy operations efficiently. And my research interest focus mainly on financial econometrics. I really think financial econometrics is very useful to make a more perfect finacial world. I love computer. And I am unremitting to learn about it. I love [Photoshop,Premiere,After Effects](http://www.adobe.com) and [Houdini](http://www.sidefx.com) because I once had a dream to be an artists to create special film effect. I love matlab(the first package I use to do programming),R(because of its various packages for the  latest statistical reseach),SAS(because  it is convenient to do data processing),python(it is a progamming language for financial econometrics),C(there is no need to place a reason for it),julia（it is a new language that I think will overtake matlab,R and python）. And I'm also have some superficial view on webpage,network technology,operating system and internet industry.I don't like MS Word(hard to compose a good-look documentation)and powerpoint(neither powerful nor pointful). I think Github is a wondeful website for me to learn all kinds of things about computer. I am very glad to comuunicate with people with similar interest with email(peter@liuhao.me).


嗨，这里是刘浩的个人主页，我现在在对外经济贸易大学读书，专业金融，大二。目前的打算是出国深造或者在国内找个更好的跳板再出国深造。我非常喜欢现代金融中各种各样让人眼晕的数学和统计学，这在很多人看来应该难以理解或者不以为然。我刚结束一段恋爱，原因不详。我现在全身心的投入到了各种与学术科研有关的事情上。学术科研中五花八门的伎俩和魔法让我无法自拔。我喜欢看别人的博客，私以为这是学习和自我提升的一个很好的方式。博客将以主要以学术、技术为主，偶尔可能也会装下文艺，看官们自行忽略就行。
